# simple-base-converter

This base converter works by passing the arguments through a command using the terminal. 
To convert a number from one base to another open the terminal or cmd in the folder containing the compiled executable and type a command that should look like this
```
executable <in_base> <out_base> <number>
```
Where number is the number you want to convert from in_base to out_base e.g
When you want to convert decimal 100 to hexadecimal, you just type
```
10 16 100
```
